**Phillip Comer | Telecom Systems & Remote Ops Consultant**

I help telecom and fixed wireless providers build smarter, faster, and more reliable networksâ€”without wasting manpower or repeating mistakes.

Iâ€™ve spent two decades doing this from the ground up: building towers, configuring LTE core equipment, engineering end-to-end systems from the dirt to the cloud. These days, I focus on what matters: automation, tunnel config, monitoring, and design consultationâ€”*so you donâ€™t burn out your team the way I burned out my body*.

I work remotely, flexibly, and deliver fast. My work gets your systems stable and your techs breathing easier. First-time consultations always available.
