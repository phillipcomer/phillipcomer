# Helix Nebula – Real Astrophotography by Phillip Comer

![Final Image](helix_final.jpg)

This is a **genuine deep-sky astrophotograph** of the Helix Nebula (NGC 7293), captured on my own equipment and processed entirely by hand using PixInsight. No AI-generated art. Just real sky, real starlight, and real work.

## 📷 Capture Details

- **Object:** Helix Nebula (NGC 7293) – planetary nebula in Aquarius
- **Equipment:** Seestar S50 Smart Telescope
- **Exposure:** 13 minutes total integration time
- **Date:** 2025
- **Location:** Missouri (general region – exact coordinates withheld)
- **Filter:** Unfiltered
- **Software Used:** PixInsight

## 🧪 Processing Summary

The raw image was carefully refined using a traditional PixInsight workflow with no automation or shortcuts. Processing included:

1. BackgroundNeutralization
2. DynamicBackgroundExtraction
3. Noise reduction via EZ Denoise
4. HistogramTransformation
5. CurvesTransformation for contrast and color
6. Final polish and annotation

## 🧩 Visual Progression

This 4-panel layout shows how the image was refined over time — from raw, to denoised, to contrast stretched, to the final calibrated and centered nebula.

## 🧠 Why This Matters

This project was more than just a photo. It was a test of patience, legacy, and clarity — a chance to prove that **human-crafted imaging still matters** in a world that increasingly automates art.

I believe this is one of the most meaningful captures I've ever worked on, and I’m proud to share it with the world.
